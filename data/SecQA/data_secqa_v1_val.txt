Question,A,B,C,D,Answer,Explanation
Which of the following best describes administrative controls in computer systems security?,Controls that are implemented after a security incident to recover and restore organization's operations.,Controls that involve the use of technology to protect data and to control access to data.,Controls that include policies and procedures that are implemented to manage the conduct of personnel.,"Controls that involve physical measures to prevent unauthorized access to facilities, equipment, and resources.",C,Administrative controls are management-oriented and are typically enforced by the organization's policies and procedures. They are designed to dictate the conduct and behavior of personnel to ensure security policies and procedures are followed.
Which of the following is an example of a physical control in computer systems security?,Firewalls and antivirus software.,Employee background checks.,Data encryption techniques.,Biometric access control systems.,D,"Physical controls are measures taken to secure the physical environment of an organization and its resources. This includes locks, access control systems, surveillance cameras, and biometric systems."
"In the context of privilege management, what is the principle of least privilege?",Assigning privileges based on seniority in the organization.,Granting users the maximum permissions possible.,Granting users only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions.,Providing all users with administrative privileges for convenience.,C,"The principle of least privilege limits users' access rights to only what is necessary for their job, reducing the risk of misuse or accidental damage."
What is a potential indicator of session hijacking in web applications?,"Anomalies in session cookies, such as unexpected changes or use.",Detection of unauthorized network devices.,Unexplained fluctuations in network bandwidth.,Rapid increase in server memory usage.,A,"Session hijacking may be indicated by anomalies in session cookies, such as unexpected changes, suggesting unauthorized access to a user’s authenticated session."
Which of the following is an essential component for securing a network against unauthorized access?,"Using a single, complex password for all devices.",Implementing network access control (NAC) systems.,Avoiding the use of encryption to simplify network management.,Disabling all wireless connections.,B,"NAC systems control access to the network by enforcing security policies, thereby preventing unauthorized access."
What is the role of Kerberos in authentication?,It provides a decentralized authentication model.,It encrypts data transmission over a network.,It is primarily used for data encryption.,It uses time-based tickets for authenticating client-server connections.,D,Kerberos is an authentication protocol that uses time-based tickets to allow for secure authentication on untrusted networks.
"In the context of web applications, how are HTTP sessions used for authorization?",They provide a secure channel for data transmission.,They are mainly used for encrypting data.,They are not related to authorization.,They use cookies to control access to resources.,D,"In web applications, HTTP sessions control access to resources by assigning a cryptographically secure session ID to users, often in the form of a cookie."
Which of the following best describes the role of the OWASP Top 10 in enhancing organizational security?,It serves as a legal framework for data protection in the European Union.,It offers a comprehensive set of security protocols for web servers.,It is a government-mandated standard for all organizations in the USA.,It provides a list of the top 10 security vulnerabilities in software applications.,D,"The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 is a standard awareness document representing the most critical security risks to web applications. Organizations use this list to understand and mitigate common vulnerabilities in software applications, thus enhancing their security posture."
"For a suspected data breach involving sensitive customer information, which of the following data sources would be most critical for the investigation?",Marketing campaign data,Data encryption protocols,Application logs,Firewall configuration files,C,"Application logs are vital in understanding the actions performed within an application. They can help trace back the activities related to a data breach, including access to sensitive customer information."
What is a primary security concern associated with 'Broken Access Control'?,Slower performance of the system due to access checks.,Unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data.,Increased network traffic due to frequent access requests.,Users being unable to access necessary resources.,B,"Broken Access Control refers to failures in restricting access to authorized users only, leading to unauthorized users potentially gaining access to sensitive data."
"In a scenario where an SOC supports a web application on self-hosted machines, what initial step might a malicious actor take to exfiltrate data?",Try to physically access the server hosting the web application.,Send phishing emails to the application's users.,Immediately launch a denial-of-service attack.,Test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities.,D,"In such a scenario, a malicious actor might start by testing the web application for SQL injection vulnerabilities, which is a common technique for attempting to exfiltrate data."
Which of the following best describes a risk assessment in the context of cybersecurity?,A process to identify and quantify financial losses due to cyber incidents.,A technical procedure to fix vulnerabilities in a network.,A legal requirement that all organizations must follow to avoid penalties.,A process to determine the potential impact of identified cybersecurity threats.,D,"Risk assessment involves evaluating identified cybersecurity threats to understand their potential impact on the organization. It is a critical component of risk management, helping organizations prioritize and address the most significant risks."
